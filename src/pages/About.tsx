          We are the <strong>Indie Language Association</strong> â€” a chaotic collection of indie language devs.
          Some of us are small. Some of us ship 200MB Electron installers for a command-line tool
          (yes, <em>looking at you</em>, W++ ðŸ‘€). But hey, it works and itâ€™s shiny.
        </p>

        <p>
          So come along! Browse our languages, download <strong>X3</strong>, <strong>W++</strong>,
          <strong> ROS</strong>, or whichever one speaks to your soul, and just enjoy the ride.
        </p>

        <p>
          We built this for fun, for learning, and maybe â€” just maybe â€” to overthrow HTML as a concept.
          (Joking... mostly.)
